            <h2>A JOURNEY THROUGH SHADOWS</h2>
            <p>
                In a village bright where laughter played,  
                A brother and sister in sunshine swayed,  
                Their mother’s warmth, a comforting light,  
                In a world full of love, everything felt right.  

                But shadows approached, dark clouds in the sky,  
                As enemies struck, and the world said goodbye,  
                With sirens wailing, they fled in a rush,  
                Through chaos and smoke, in a desperate hush.  

                They journeyed together, hope lighting their way,  
                But the road was unforgiving, their spirits turned gray,  
                At the refugee camp, only two would remain,  
                A brother and sister, bound by their pain.  

                The brother left his sister, his heart filled with dread,  
                In search of their mother, his soul nearly bled,  
                Through the rubble and ashes, he called out her name,  
                But found her last breath, consumed by the flame.  

                In the glow of despair, her body lay still,  
                A heart-wrenching sight, yet he fought with his will,  
                He returned to his sister, the truth left unsaid,  
                “Mother will come back,” though he knew she left this world.  

                The sister grew weak, her laughter now dim,  
                As hunger crept close, she whispered to him,  
                “Brother, I’m hungry, the night feels so long,”  
                A plea in the darkness, where shadows belong.  

                One fateful day, as shadows grew tall,  
                He snatched at the rice, answering her call.  
                With a heart full of hope, he sought to appease,  
                To nourish her spirit, to bring her some ease.  

                But the happiness faded, a cruel twist of fate,  
                He found her so still, her spirit had flown.  
                He buried her gently beneath the soft earth,  
                A hero in life, now stripped of mirth.  

                For he lost everything, his sister, his family,  
                In the depths of despair, saw no means to mend.  
                With no will to live, he wandered the night,  
                A ghost of his past, in a world void of light.  

                But in dreams he would find her, in the heavens above,  
                Reunited with family, enveloped in love.  
                Through the trials of sorrow, their spirits entwined,  
                A brother and sister, forever aligned.  

                For in the war’s shadow, where hope was once bright,  
                Flickers of fireflies guide them to light.  
                Their laughter, their tears, in the stars now reside,  
                A legacy of love that can never divide.  

                In the hearts of the lost, their spirits take flight,  
                Together forever, through the darkest of night.

            <h2>A World He'll Never Know</h2>
            <p>
                Tomorrow when the rescuers uncover this sorrow,  
                They will bear the child, with his mother, brother, and sister,  
                Wrapped in shadows, remnants of joy now hollow,  
                Searching for survivors in the wake of the sorrow.  

                But tonight, he is alive, today he is born,  
                In the midst of war's chaos, hope still adorns,  
                Everyone is joyful, dreaming of the big man he’ll be,  
                Brother and sister welcome him with hearts full of glee.  
                He moves his new eyes, hands, and stares at the hospital roof,  
                In the warm embrace of family, love surrounds him, a soothing truth.  
                But suddenly, the air is pierced by sirens’ wails,  
                A thunderous roar echoes, as chaos prevails.  
                The ground trembles violently, as shadows descend,  
                A loud noise erupts, where laughter had been penned,  
                In an instant, all turns to dust, dreams left to drift,  
                Yet in that fleeting moment, a child's light is a gift.
